#Muvia: Accessible and Inclusive Virtual World


Muvia stands for "Accessible and Inclusive Virtual World", in spanish: "MUndo Virtual Inclusivo y Accesible". 

This is an academic research project, authored by Cesar Pach√≥n (github.com/cesarpachon, www.cesarpachon.com) as part of his Thesis in the Master of Free Software with the Autonomous University of Bucaramanga (www.unab.edu.co), and as a continuation of his Thesis in the Master of e-learning, with the same university. 

Currently, it is a work in an very early stage of progress!  


## what is the goal of the project? 

MUVIA tries to implement a web-based virtual world capable of support interaction between children with different kinds of dissabilities, and between them and children without disabilities, doing its best to offer a seamless experience to all the users, without regarding their particular usability features. 

This is the part that deals with the "accesibility" word in its name. 

MUVIA tries to break down not only disabilities, but also limitations in the use of the platform due to socio-economic conditions. To do this, the project avoid high-tech latest technologies like WebGL, who are poorly ported across devices and also demands expensive hardware in order to run smoothly.  breaking economic breaches implies to be able to run in lower-end devices, and as many as possible withouth degrading experience; but also requires to guarantee free access to the solution: this is where Open Source comes to the rescue and this is where the "Inclusive" word in the name appears.
